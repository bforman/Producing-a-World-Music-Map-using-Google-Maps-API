# Producing-a-World-Music-Map-using-Google-Maps-API
This repository provides an overview into how to approach producing a world map or perhaps a map of a portion of the world using the Google Maps Engine API for Python. This inquiry takes a look at an existing world music map and expresses the limitations of the existing project and how it might be improved. The process of installing the Python client library and obtaining a Google Maps Engine API key is covered as well

# Problem
We want to begin creating an effective and interactive world music map using the Google Maps Engine API for Python

# Questions
1. What are the preliminary steps in getting the project up and running?
2. What World Music Maps using the Google Maps API already exist?
3. What are the some of the faults and limitations of the existing project(s) and how can they be improved?
